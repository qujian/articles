* How to attach process in vscode with non-root user
** senaro:

I need to debug in Docker use vscode, and my docker is login as a non-root user, so I met the problem: 

#+BEGIN_SRC
Superuser access is required to attach to a process, but authorisation can't be confirmed since there is an extra line in the terminal.
#+END_SRC

so I tried to attach the process with a gdb command in docker, but it 


#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ gdb --pid 5291

Attaching to process 5291
Could not attach to process.  If your uid matches the uid of the target
process, check the setting of /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope, or try
again as the root user.  For more details, see /etc/sysctl.d/10-ptrace.conf
ptrace: Operation not permitted.
(gdb)

#+END_SRC

try to change 


#+BEGIN_SRC bash
vi /etc/sysctl.d/10-ptrace.conf
#+END_SRC


#+BEGIN_SRC bash
kernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 1

#+END_SRC

to:


#+BEGIN_SRC bash
kernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 0

#+END_SRC

and got:


#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/10-ptrace.conf 
sysctl: setting key "kernel.yama.ptrace_scope", ignoring: Read-only file system

#+END_SRC

the try to change value in the host:


#+BEGIN_SRC bash
echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope 

# go to docker
cat /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope 
0

#+END_SRC

and now I can attach debug in my vscode `launch.json`


#+BEGIN_SRC json
